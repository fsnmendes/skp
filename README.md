# SKP: SomeKnowledgeProof

An insecure platform for evidence verification where Party A can submit evidence and Party B can verify it without ever seeing the actual content. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Google's Gemini AI.

## Features

- üîí Secure evidence submission and verification
- üñºÔ∏è Support for multiple file types:
  - Images (JPG, PNG, GIF)
  - Documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
  - Audio (MP3, WAV)
  - Video (MP4, MOV)
- ü§ñ AI-powered verification using Google's Gemini
- üì± Modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- üîê Secure session management
- üéØ Focused verification process

## Security Considerations

- Evidence is never revealed to Party B
- All file uploads are validated and sanitized
- Sessions are managed securely
- Prompt injection detection
- File size limits and type validation
